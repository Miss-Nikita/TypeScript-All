// Primitive - Number String Boolean
// TypeScript :- TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.
// TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.
// For example, TypeScript will report an error when passing a string into a function that expects a number. JavaScript will not.


console.log("hello from Type script");

// $ tsc script.ts --watch
